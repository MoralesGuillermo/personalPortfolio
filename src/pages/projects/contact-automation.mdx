title: "Japanese Students Contact Automation"
description: "Contacting hundreds of students can be a burdening tasks. Hundreds of messages, missing students, incorrect emails, etc. can be problems that drain a professor's energy. This automation solved this issues for the professors of the Honduran Association of Ex Scholars of Japan (AHBEJA). Discover the impact of this automation here!"

## About the Automation
Every 3 months, a new trimester of japanese classes starts at the Honduran Association of Ex Scholars of Japan (AHBEJA). Each time, professors need to contactact their students to provide them with the official links to their online classrooms, assets, and other relevant material. 

Professors may have from 20 to 30 students per section, complicating the action of contacting each of them one by one. This software solves this problem by giving the professors a tool to automate the task of contacting students, saving hours of their time.

## Project Impact
The purpose of this project was to help professors save time on contacting their students, leveraging those tasks to automation. Also, to mitigate the risk of not contacting a student that enrolled later to the course.

### Time efficiency
Now professors can easily contact their students, using the same tools they were using (Whatsapp), meanwhile having a registry of contacted, uncontacted, and new students. Professors now leverage this repetitive task to the software to focus their time on improving their class!
