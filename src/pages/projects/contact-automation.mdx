## About the Automation

Temis is a legal tech startup envisioned to help lawyers manage their cases, clients, files, etc. the smart way. With Temis, people in the legal business can focus on their higher priority tasks. 

Temis helps lawyers organize their workloads and have all their resources at a single place and ready to be accessed.

## Project Impact
The purpose of this project was to help professors save time on contacting their students, leveraging that tasks to the automation. Also, to mitigate the risk of not contacting a student that enrolled later to the course.

### Time efficiency
Now professors can easily contact their students, using the same tools they were using (whatsapp), meanwhile having a registry of contacted, not-contacted, and new students. Professors now leverage this repetitive task to the software to focus their time on improving their class!
