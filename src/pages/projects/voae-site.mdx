## About this project

The Students Affairs Office (VOAE) of the National Autonomous University of Honduras (UNAH) needed a modern look for its web site. In colaboration with more engineers, we desinged and developed a fresh look for VOAE.

With this revamp, VOAE's image was more modern and attractive to aspirants and students at UNAH! Now, students are using the site to get to know VOAE and its events, services, and more, reducing the workload on VOAE's staff to focus on their main and top priority tasks.

## Project Impact

### Workload Reduction and Time Consumption
Students now can check the VOAE's site to receive information about their services and future events, eliminating the necessity to head to VOAE to ask about these information, reducing the workload on VOAE's staff and the time consumption of the students going to the VOAE office.

### Student Attraction
Now with a modern and fresh site, students are more attracted to VOAE and its services.

### Faster contact
Students now can be in contact with VOAE officials across the entire country in seconds by the availability of their contact information on the office's site.


## My role at the Project
Alongside my teammates, we designed and developed the site, following constraints and using internal systems of UNAH.
