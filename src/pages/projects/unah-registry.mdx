## About the Project

The UNAH is a massive institution that has enrolled thousands of students that access their systems every day. We were tasked to design and develop a new backoffice system for the registry and enrollment section at UNAH.

The vision was to improve the current system by adding new key features that would help reduce the workload of the system users while having constraints in the development process.

## Project Impact
The revamped registry backoffice system offered a solution with new features that would help students, teachers and administrators in their daily tasks as users of the university.

### Grade management
With this system, teachers now can easily manage all their courses and students, with the new ability of uploading grades by using spreadsheets, accelerating the grade upload process and making it more comfortable for teachers 

### Applicant's flow
Now, applicants have a centralized system that guides them through their entire enrollment process. Applicants can check their application status, admission exams grades and check if they were accepted to the university.

### Course management
Department and career chiefs can manage the workloads among professors by having full control of courses availability per semester.

### Real-time chat
Students can communicate with their peers in a real time chat, making new connections with their classmates.
